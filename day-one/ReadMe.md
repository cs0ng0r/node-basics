# Day One - Setup

Today I learned how to setup a basic Node.JS server.

I also learnt about the `http` and `fs` modules.

## http module
Using this module I was able to create a server with it's built-in `createServer()` function.

## fs module

With this module, I was able to read the `page.html` file and display it's content generated by ChatGPT. (I wanted to display something that makes sense)

I was able to do this using the `readFile()` function.
